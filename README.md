Overview of the Project: Library Management System in Python
The primary objective of this project is to develop a simple, user-friendly graphical interface application to manage library activities such as adding books, issuing books to users, and tracking book returns. The system allows librarians or users to view the book list, update records, and maintain an organized system.

Technologies Used
Python Programming Language is Used as the core language to develop the application because of its simplicity and versatility.
Tkinter Library for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the program, making it interactive and easy to navigate.
SQLite (or Basic Data Storage) for maintaining a persistent database to store book records, borrower details, and transaction history.
Basic Logical Operations Used to implement core functionality like adding books, issuing, and updating records.
Cross-Platform Compatibility Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux without requiring additional software.

Features of the Application
Add Books: Easily add new books with details like title, author, and availability.
Issue Books: Assign books to borrowers and track due dates.
Return Books: Update book status and calculate any applicable fines.
Search Books: Quickly search for specific books using filters.
View Records: Display all books, current borrowings, and transaction logs.
Admin Controls: Clear or update the database, ensuring library operations run smoothly.
